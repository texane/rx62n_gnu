Everything needed is in explained in this post by DJ Delorie:

Configure the RX USB port for "USB Device" (aka "FUNCT") - on/off/off/on for SW6.
Configure the MCU MODE (SW5) for off/on/on/on (USB boot mode)
Jumper the "J-LINK DISABLE" (JP13).
You can power the RDK either via the RX USB port (like I do) or via the wall wart.  If you use the wall wart, you may need to power cycle the board for each download to ensure the device is re-discovered.
Plug in the USB cable.  Your /var/log/messages should show a USB device of 045b:0025
Run "rxusb -v your_program.elf"  (rxusb is one of my flash tools).  You'll either need to be root to do this, or use udev to make 045b:0025 world-writable.  Of course, you could make rxusb setuid-root too.
Turn SW5.2 OFF (the MCU mode now matches "RUN") and press RESET (SW4).  Your program should be running now!
